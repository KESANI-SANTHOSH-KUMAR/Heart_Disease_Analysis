# 📊 Large Dataset Analysis

The dataset contains multiple medical attributes related to heart health.

We performed:

✔ Data Cleaning  
✔ Missing Value Handling  
✔ Data Transformation  
✔ Statistical Summary Generation  
✔ Correlation Analysis  
✔ Distribution Analysis  
✔ Comparative Risk Study  

The system processes and analyzes structured health records efficiently.

# 📈 Tableau Visualizations

To provide deeper insights, interactive Tableau dashboards were created, including:

- Age Distribution Analysis  
- Cholesterol Level Comparison  
- Blood Pressure Trends  
- Chest Pain Type Analysis  
- Gender-wise Risk Distribution  
- Maximum Heart Rate Analysis  
- Multi-parameter Correlation Study  

These dashboards help:

- Identify high-risk groups  
- Understand relationships between medical parameters  
- Support data-driven healthcare awareness

# 🩺 Dataset Attributes

The analysis is based on medical parameters such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Serum Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG Results  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- Exercise Induced Angina  
- ST Depression  
- Number of Major Vessels  
- Thalassemia
